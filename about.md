## Who We Are, What We Do
The Americas Grid Policy Management Authority (TAGPMA) is a federation of authentication providers and relying parties headed by a Policy Management Authority of those responsible for grids in North, Central and South America. Our goal is to foster the cross-domain trust relationships that are needed to deploy grids in the Americas and around the world.

This federation is open to any grid-related authentication provider or relying party in the Americas. Through multiple recognized authentication profiles, we will work with many different types authorities whether they implement a classic public key infrastructure or not.

We are also involved globally with other regional grid PMA's - EUGridPMA and APGridPMA - to define authentication profiles and related minimum requirements. Members who meet these minimum requirements will be trusted globally through our involvement in the Interoperable Global Trust Federation.
